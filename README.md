# Projectlab: embedded C coding

## Project Lumen gameconsole
*Lumen: Language for Ultraportable and Microcontroller Embedded eNvironments*

This is a school project, feel free to wander around.

The idea of the project is to make a game console which:

	* Runs a Lumen interpreter
	* Lumen code comes preprocessed in bytecode
	* can output to an LCD or a VGA display
	* supports sound (not a priority!)
	* get input from a handheld controller
	* should be able to support multiplayer
	* loads a game from an SD card

Furthermore we are more or less obliged to write an FRS, based on that we write te code. The project structure should be a three tier structure, if needed more.
