Project Lumen Game Console

General description:

	The game console we developed runs in an interpreted language called 'Lumen'. Also called to life by us, because of several reasons: it adds a nice facet to our assignment, its a new challenge for us and who doesn't want a programming language of his own! Keep in mind we need a preprocessing of the bare 'Lumen' code on a slightly more powerfull machine to generate the required bytecode. This is necessary to keep the memory footprint of interpreter as small as possible.
	The console consists of several inputs and outputs: 
		Inputs:
			- SD card (SPI) for reading the bytecode game code into the system
			- wired console('s) for controlling the gameplay (I2C or SPI?)			
////////--->					(N: capbility for multiplayer? Can this cause performance issues?)
		Outputs:
			- Standard VGA output (through I2C and second controller as graphics card)
			- support for LCD display, support for LED dot display
			- audio (3,5mm jack)

		Specs and conventions:
			- PIC18F452 for graphics
			- PIC18F4620 for interpreter and I/O
			- Ram for running game: 2048 bytes?


Software blocks:
	- VGA driver
	- LCD driver
	- Graphics control
