General description:

The graphics control is located entirely in a separate microcontroller. It's tasks consist of: writing the content on the screen, recievive this content over an SPI connection and do the required computations to maintain the correct timing for the VGA protocol.

The graphics control makes use of maps, filled with tiles and sprites. Therefore it provides several commands to fill and edit the graphical content.
