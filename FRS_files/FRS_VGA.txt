FRS VGA

General description:

The graphics control is located entirely in a separate microcontroller. Its tasks consist of: writing the content on the screen, recieve this content over an SPI connection and do the required computations to maintain the correct timing for the VGA protocol.

The graphics control makes use of maps, filled with tiles and sprites. To accomplish this it provides several commands to fill and edit the graphical content.
The SPI communication is used to set up a byte oriented protocol. It had commands to initialize sprites and tiles, to fill the map and to draw sprites on the screen at user specified locations.

The output of the graphics control is send to a standard VGA display (640x480 60Hz). The actual resolution of the graphics control is reduced to 128x96, this is done for performance issues. 

Inputs and outputs:
The SPI interface uses 2 I/O lines: Clock and MasterOut/SlaveIn.
The VGA output takes 5 I/O lines: red, green, blue, horizontal sync and vertical sync.
